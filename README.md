# 📱 Math Buddy

A fun, minimal, and focused multiplication game built with SwiftUI — 100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge.

## 🎯 Overview

Math Buddy is an interactive multiplication practice app designed for kids and learners of all ages.
It lets users choose how far they want to go (e.g. 2x, 5x, 10x tables), set the number of questions, and play through a gamified quiz experience — complete with instant feedback, scoring, and beautiful animations.

This project is a part of my 100 Days of SwiftUI learning journey — focusing on state management, view transitions, gradients, user interaction, and UI composition.

## 🧩 Features

- ✨ Clean and beginner-friendly SwiftUI structure
- 🧠 Random question generation for each round
- ⚡ Instant correctness feedback
- 🏆 Scoreboard and result summary
- 🎨 Dark blue–black gradient design with vibrant accents
- 📱 Adaptive layout for all iPhone screen sizes

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Building a multi-screen experience in SwiftUI using an enum-based state machine
- Managing app flow with view transitions (setup → play → results)
- Handling user input safely with state and bindings
- Using clean and readable SwiftUI code structures
- Designing an accessible, minimal interface with gradient themes
